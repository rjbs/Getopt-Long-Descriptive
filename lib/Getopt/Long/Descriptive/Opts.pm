# ABSTRACT: object representing command line switches

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is the base class of all C<$opt> objects returned by
L<Getopt::Long::Descriptive>.  In general, you do not want to think about this
class, look at it, or alter it.  Seriously, it's pretty dumb.

Every call to C<describe_options> will return a object of a new subclass of
this class.  It will have a method for the canonical name of each option
possible given the option specifications.

Method names beginning with an single underscore are public, and are named that
way to avoid conflict with automatically generated methods.  Methods with
multiple underscores (in case you're reading the source) are private.

=head1 METHODS

B<Achtung!>  All methods beginning with an underscore are experimental as of
today, 2009-12-12.  They are likely to be formally made permanent soon.

=head2 _specified

This method returns true if the given name was specified on the command line.

For example, if C<@ARGS> was "C<< --foo --bar 10 >>" and C<baz> is defined by a
default, C<_specified> will return true for foo and bar, and false for baz.

sub _specified {
  my ($self, $name) = @_;
  my $meta = $_CREATED_OPTS{ blessed $self }{meta};
  return $meta->{given}{ $name };
}

=head2 _specified_opts

This method returns an opt object in which only explicitly specified values are
defined.  Values which were set by defaults will appear undef.

sub _specified_opts {
  my ($self) = @_;

  my $class = blessed $self;
  my $meta = $_CREATED_OPTS{ $class  }{meta};

  return $meta->{specified_opts} if $meta->{specified_opts};

=head2 _complete_opts

This method returns the opts object with all values, including those set by
defaults.  It is probably not going to be very often-used.

  # This is stupid, but the traditional behavior was that if --foo was not
  # given, there is no $opt->{foo}; it started to show up when we "needed" all
  # the keys to generate a class, but was undef; this wasn't a problem, but
  # broke tests of things that were relying on not-exists like tests of %$opt
  # contents or MooseX::Getopt which wanted to use things as args for new --
  # undef would not pass an Int TC.  Easier to just do this. -- rjbs,
